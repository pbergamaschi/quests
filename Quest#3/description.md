You'll find two versions of the same file: 
    1. Release Note NEW.md
    2. Release Note OLD.md

"Release Note NEW.md" represents a newer version of the same file, your mission is to compare the files to generate a third file called "whatsnew.md" that contains only the lines that are in "Release Note NEW.md" but not in "Release Note OLD.md".

#bonus track
"Release Note.md" represents a new format I'm trying to push to replace the old "changelog.txt", I followed the Markdown semantic to create something prettier and easier to read (unfortunately it's only in italian right now), try to open it in "preview mode" (CTRL + K V ) in "visual studio code"
